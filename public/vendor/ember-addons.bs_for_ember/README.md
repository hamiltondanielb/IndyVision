# Bootstrap for Ember

_Bootstrap for Ember.js_ is a collection of UI components based on Twitter Bootstrap *v3* for Ember.js

_Bootstrap for Ember_ goes much further than using plain Bootstrap by providing _extra functionality_ by leveraging the 
power of Ember.

With the power of _Ember.js_ and the beauty of _Bootstrap_, expect interactive, clean, lightweight, powerful 
and most importantly very easy to use components. In fact, using the components is usually much easier and shorter than 
using Bootstrap as is, see showcase!

## ShowCase

> A picture is worth a thousand words

### [See ShowCase](http://ember-addons.github.io/bootstrap-for-ember/dist)

### Also visit our new [Ember Forms](http://ember-addons.github.io/ember-forms/#/overview) project

## Why?

Because Bootstrap is awesome but using it as is for _Ember_ apps makes code dirty as the interaction with Controllers
or other Ember components requires code wiring.

This project is heavily based on [Ember Components](http://emberjs.com/guides/components/), which makes the usage of
the components fun and doesnt ruin the simplicy of Bootstrap usage at all,

## Important!

**This project is under AGGRESSIVE development and changes constantly, if you find it interesting, we suggest you to 
watch it or visit often to see the new stuff, and if you like it, _star_ it :-)**
